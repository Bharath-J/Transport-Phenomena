# Transport-Phenomena
Here are two small programs to illustrate the diffusion concept from the microscopic point of view (the drunkard's walk) and from the macroscopic point of view (transient diffusion PDE solution). They have a Qt graphical interface to ease their use. In order to run them, you need python(version 2.x, not 3.x)+scipy+matplotlib+Qt4 library.
